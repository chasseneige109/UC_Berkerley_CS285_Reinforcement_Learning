# UC_Berkerley_CS285_Reinforcement_Learning

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the CS285: Reinforcement Learning course (Fall 2023) from UC Berkeley. 
Due to version conflicts and other difficulties, I recreated the assignments and projects to provide a more streamlined and functional version.

Homework Breakdown

Homework 1: Imitation Learning

Homework 2: Policy Gradients

Homework 3: Q-learning and Actor-Critic Algorithms

Homework 4: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

Homework 5: Exploration and Offline Reinforcement Learning

These solutions include detailed implementations of key RL algorithms and methods discussed in the course.
