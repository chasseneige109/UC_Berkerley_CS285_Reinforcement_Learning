# UC_Berkerley_CS285_Reinforcement_Learning
### I am currently taking this course and will be continuously updating this repository.

This repository contains my solutions and code implementations for the CS285: Reinforcement Learning course (Fall 2023) at UC Berkeley.
Due to version conflicts and other issues, I have recreated the assignments and projects from scratch using Gemini, to provide a more streamlined and functional version.

Assignments:
- Homework 1: Imitation Learning
- Homework 2: Policy Gradients
- Homework 3: Q-learning and Actor-Critic Algorithms
- Homework 4: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
- Homework 5: Exploration and Offline Reinforcement Learning
